# Architecture Breakdowns

I wanted to learn how certain things are architectured so I started learning [Mermaid](https://www.mermaidchart.com) and breaking down how projects are structured for better clarity with a JS script that goes into each package and summarizes concepts with LMStudio + Llama running locally so I can create architecture diagrams with Mermaid.

## How To
- Use [Mermaid Playground](https://www.mermaidchart.com/play)
